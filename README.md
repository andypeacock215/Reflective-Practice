# Reflective Practice


## Description
Over the course of the 8-week Data Technician Skills Bootcamp, I have learned and applied a wide range of new skills, including Excel, Tableau, Power BI, SQL, Microsoft Azure, and Python. These tools were introduced to help with data analysis, visualization, and communication, and I was tasked with applying them to real-world scenarios. While my prior experience in mathematics and teaching gave me a solid foundation for understanding data analysis, many of the tools, particularly Tableau, Power BI, and Azure, were entirely new to me, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for growth.


## Feelings
Overall, I felt excited and motivated throughout the course. I particularly enjoyed Python and SQL, as they appealed to my logical way of thinking and problem-solving nature. While I initially found some tools, like Power BI and Azure, challenging due to their complexity and the volume of new terminology, I also felt a sense of accomplishment when I managed to navigate these systems and produce meaningful insights. At times, challenges arose when such as trying to fully understand Azure’s broad range of services or when encountering limitations in the labs. However, this only deepened my determination to improve.


## Evaluation
The experience was overwhelmingly positive. My extensive prior knowledge of Excel allowed me to delve deeper into advanced features, such as using tables, macros, and optimizing PivotTables. My success in Python and SQL reaffirmed my confidence in my logical thinking and coding abilities, while Tableau’s user-friendly interface enabled me to create interactive dashboards, which I found highly rewarding. However, challenges like understanding Power BI’s database configuration and Azure’s vast array of services reminded me of the steep learning curve that comes with new systems. Despite these hurdles, I felt that my persistence and adaptability paid off, as I was able to make steady progress.


## Analysis
The challenges I faced with Power BI and Azure highlighted areas where I needed to allocate more time and effort. Power BI required me to understand database structures and new terminology, but my familiarity with Microsoft applications helped me navigate the interface. Similarly, Azure’s licensing limitations and its extensive service options meant I couldn’t explore it as deeply as I would have liked. Conversely, my prior experience with Excel and my aptitude for logical thinking greatly supported my success in Python, SQL, and data visualization tasks. I learned that while prior knowledge can be a strong foundation, continuous learning and adaptability are key to mastering new tools.


## Conclusion
From this experience, I have realized that while I excel in grasping logical and structured concepts like Python and SQL, I need to dedicate more time to improving my understanding of tools like Power BI and Azure. I also learned the importance of perseverance when faced with challenges and how utilizing available resources, such as AI for Python, can enhance productivity. The course has reignited my passion for learning and problem-solving, reinforcing my commitment to refining my skills and applying them effectively in a business environment.
